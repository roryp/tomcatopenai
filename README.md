Deploy the application to Tomcat: Copy the .war file to the webapps directory of your Tomcat installation. Tomcat will automatically deploy the application.

Remember to set the AZURE_OPENAI_KEY, AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT, and AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_ID environment variables with your actual Azure OpenAI key, endpoint, and model ID before starting Tomcat. You can set these variables in the script that you use to start Tomcat, or in your system's environment variables.
